# Project Pinpoint

A compilation of designs and theories to "pinpoint" the major areas of focus for building the system.

## Proposals

- Latest kernel (will be built and distributed vanilla)
- Updates every 5-6 months (kernel, software, features, upstream patches)
- Kernel security AND feature updates are essential
- Basic updater program to facilitate in-place upgrades
- Extraneous software removed
- Custom boot image
- Graphical user interface (GUI) that is easily extensible and lightweight

## Roadblocks

- **Disk space / bandwidth:** Building the system comes at a monetary cost.
- **Support:** Unless extensive testing is done, performance and reliability cannot be assured.
- **Updates:** Packages will need to be build very rapidly. In the case of the kernel, quickly pushing updates would only be possible with a program written to generate and patch the kernel for every new release.
- **Website / documentation:** There is no website planned for the time being. However, a basic instruction manual is still being considered.
